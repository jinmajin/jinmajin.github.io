				<p>The very base of personal finance is the budget. A budget can help you generate a positive, reliable cash
				flow, and will keep you more knowledgeable on your finances in general, as you will have to handle them at least
				once a month. This guide will teach you to analyze your spending, identify areas in which you can save, and then 
				focus on cutting expenses. </p>
                <span class="title">Analyzing Your Spending</span>
            	<p>Before you begin writing a budget, you have to analyze your spending.</p>
				<p>For one month, track all of your expenses. Simply tracking your spending will probably cut down your expenses
				as you'll see the aggregate sum you've spent every time you log another purchase. You can do this manually with a
				simple note-taking app, or if you want something that will track all your expenses automatically, you can use <a class="link" href="https://www.mint.com/">Mint</a>.</p>
				<p>Mint will record all transactions that occurs in the accounts you link to it, and also create graphs out of the data
				it collects, so you will be able to see all of your transactions and visualize your aggregate spending in one place. </p>
                <p>After a month, look at your total expenses for every category. How much did you spend on Food? Entertainment? 
				Now that you know, it's time to identify areas in which you can save.</p>
				<span class="title">Identifying Your Problem Areas</span>
				<p>Where are you spending too much? Now that you have a month's worth of data, you can probably identify these. </p>

                attended the 
                <a class="link" href="http://ncssm.edu/">North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics</a>. I love video games
                and food.</p>

                    <a class="link" href="https://www.ibj.jp/">Internet Business Japan</a>, I created a summer-themed game for the 
                    <a class="link" href="https://www.hwc.jp/">HWC</a> mascot, Howaco. I was tasked with both design and
                    implementation, and came up with the idea for the game when I learned of the traditional Japanese summer game, 
                    <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suikawari">suikawari</a>. The game is available 
                    <a class="link" href="https://www.hwc.jp/games/suika/game.html">online</a> and in the

                    exercise website, GroupFit, with 3 other team members. I was tasked mainly with UI Design and implementation,
