                <span class="title">Budgeting</span>
				<p>The very base of personal finance is the budget. A budget can help you generate a positive, reliable cash
				flow, and will keep you knowledgeable on your finances, as you will have to handle them at least
				once a month. This guide will teach you to analyze your spending cut expenses. </p>
                <span class="title">Analyzing Your Spending</span>
            	<p>Before you begin writing a budget, you have to analyze your spending.</p>
				<p>For one month, track all of your expenses. Simply tracking your spending will probably cut down your expenses
				as you'll see the aggregate sum you've spent every time you log another purchase. You can do this manually with a
				simple note-taking app, or if you want something that will track all your expenses automatically, you can use <a class="link" href="https://www.mint.com/">Mint</a>.</p>
				<p>Mint will record all transactions that occur in the accounts you link to it, and also create graphs out of the data
				it collects, so you will be able to see all of your transactions and visualize your aggregate spending in one place. You
				can also use it to make budgets, and it will automatically alert you if you are getting close to overspending.</p>
                <p>After a month, look at your total expenses for every category. How much did you spend on Food? Entertainment? 
				Now that you know, you should identify areas in which you can save.</p>
				<span class="title">Cutting Expenses</span>
				<p>Your costs for utilities and rent are probably relatively constant, so you should add these to your budget. For other areas,
				if you think you spent a typical amount in that category for the month, add those amounts to your budget, too. Finally, identify the 
				categories where you think you overspent.</p>
				<p>For each of these problem areas, think about how much you actually want to spend on them in a month. Make that your budget
				for that category, and whenever you're about to make a purchase in that category, check to make sure you have enough left in your
				budget to make the purchase. For example, if you spent $400 on eating out, but think you shouldn't be spending more than $200 a 
				month on that, put that in your budget. Keep track of how much you spend every time you go out to eat. Then, before you decide to eat out, 
				make sure you have enough left in your budget to do so.</p>
				<p>Obviously, it's better to just not go out to eat if you don't have enough money left in your budget. But if you absolutely feel the need
				to do so, you can underspend in other categories to make up for it. It's better not to make a habit of doing this, but the bottom line is that you
				want to make sure you are under budget overall. Budgets are for stabilizing/limiting expenses and increasing savings.</p>
				<p>Here are a few typical ways to cut spending beyond making budgets for certain spending categories:</p>
				<p class="list">1. Cut cable and opt for a cheaper way to get TV, such as <a class="link" href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a>.</p>
				<p class="list">2. Switch your mobile plan to a cheaper carrier. Do you really need a data plan? <a class="link" href="https://republicwireless.com/">Republic Wireless</a>
				offers unlimited talk and text for $10 a month. Another cheap option is <a class="link" href="https://www.airvoicewireless.com/">Airvoice Wireless</a>.</p>

            <div class="main" id="saving">
                <p>Have extra $$? Here's what to do with them.</p>
				<p class="list title">1. Emergency fund of 3-6 months expenses</p>
				<p class="explanation">You never know what can go wrong. You might lose your job, suddenly get hospitalized, have your car break down, etc. This
				is your safety cushion for all terrible scenarios. Keeping an emergency fund is much better than not having one and as a result having to put
				a major expense that you can't immediately pay off on a credit card with 22%+ interest rates.</p>
				<p class="list title">2. Fund 401k up to match</p>
				<p class="explanation">This will give you a guaranteed return on your money that you will not get ANYWHERE else. Your employer is essentially doubling
				your money for every dollar up to the match limit. Absolutely take it.</p>
				<p class="explanation">As for what funds to buy within your 401k, try to get a balanced/diversified portfolio (good mix of US and international stocks/bonds) 
				with low expense ratios (&lt; 1%). If retirement is still very far away, you may want to have a 90% stock 10% bond ratio. Closer to retirement, this should be
				near 50% stock 50% bond.</p>
				<p class="list title">3. Pay off high interest (&gt;4%) debts</p>
				<p class="explanation">Dependent on your taste for risk, you may consider 3% interest rates high as well. Paying off debt with a 4% interest rate is
				the same as putting money into a savings account with a guaranteed 4% return. Knock out those high interest debts. For low interest debts, you can just
				pay the minimum on them, as investment vehicles (such as 401k, IRA, or taxable investment accounts) will grow faster than your low interest debts in the
				long term.</p>
				<p class="list title">4. Fund IRA up to limit</p>
				<p class="explanation">Roth and Traditional IRAs have income limits. These change each year and are available on the web. If you are above the income limit for both
				Roth and Traditional IRAs, check out <a class="link" href="http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Backdoor_Roth_IRA">Backdoor Roth IRAs</a>.</p>
				<p class="explanation">If you're below the income limits for both IRAs, depending on your income, you'll want to choose either a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. With 
				Roth IRAs, you make after-tax contributions. In other words, you get taxed on your earnings now and you won't get taxed when you withdraw. With Traditional IRAs, you 
				make pre-tax contributions, so you don't get taxed on your income now, but you get taxed when you withdraw the money. Essentially, what this boils down to is whether 
				you think your income tax will be higher in retirement or not. Ask yourself these two questions to decide this: 1. How much money do you expect to withdraw each year 
				in retirement? 2. Are you currently earning more than that? If your answer to 2 is yes, then Traditional is the way to go. Otherwise, fund a Roth.</p>
				<p class="explanation">For either option, you want to choose to buy a balanced portfolio with low expense ratios. If you don't want to be super involved in this (you just want something
				to buy and forget), I would recommend <a class="link" href="https://investor.vanguard.com/home/">Vanguard</a>'s <a class="link" href="https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/target-retirement/#/">Target Retirement</a> funds. Choose the fund closest to the year you're most likely to retire in. 
				Vanguard's retirement funds give you a balanced portfolio for a low expense ratio that slowly shifts towards more bonds as you approach retirement. It's a very good "buy and forget" option.</p>
				<p class="explanation">If you have a lot of money to invest (tens of thousands) and want to lower expense ratios further, I'd recommend looking into Vanguard's various <a class="link" href="https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/admiral-shares">Admiral Shares</a>, 
				bought in a ratio similar to the retirement funds (though you can probably forgo the international bonds). If you follow this route, you'd want to rebalance your portfolio annually 
				(buy/sell shares so that you follow the retirement fund ratio). </p>
				<p class="list title">5. Fund 401k up to limit</p>
				<p class="explanation">Tax-advantaged investment vehicles are always better than taxable accounts.</p>
				<p class="list title">6. Invest in taxable investment accounts</p>
				<p class="explanation">If you've made it to this step, you're doing great! Now that you've maxed out all of your tax-advantaged investment vehicles, you should save excess in taxable
				accounts. As with all your investments, go for a diversified/balanced portfolio with a low expense ratio.</p>
				<p>If you are saving for some sort of goal (such as a house downpayment), use appropriate savings vehicles. Don't put short-term savings into the stock market. If the major
				purchase is going to occur within 2-3 years, use secure savings methods like FDIC insured high-interest savings or I Bonds. If it's closer to 7 years down
				the line, place savings in taxable investment vehicles.</p>

            <div class="main" id="credit">
				<p class="title">Your Credit</p>
                <p>Having a good credit score is important. Your credit score is a big factor in determining the interest rate at which a bank loans you money, or if you can get a loan at all. The very
				first thing you should do is get your free <a class="link" href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/">Annual Credit Report</a>. Make sure you know what all of the items on your report are.
				If you find a line of credit that you never applied for on your account, report it as fraud. One thing to note is that if your parents put you on their credit card as an authorized user, you are 
				probably reaping the benefits/harms of that line of credit.</p>
				<p><a class="link" href="https://www.creditkarma.com/">Credit Karma</a> also provides your free TransUnion credit report (updated bi-weekly) and a free credit score estimator.</p>
                <p>The easiest way to create and maintain a good credit score is to own 2-3 credit cards and pay them off in full every month.</p>
                <p class="title">Benefits of Credit Cards:</p>
				<p class="list">1. You are never responsible for fraud. Unlike debit cards, where you may be responsible for someone else stealing and using your card, credit cards never place burden of payment on the
				end user (you).</p>
				<p class="list">2. Lots of free perks, like free car insurance for rentals and extended warranty. Most credit cards will cover car insurance for any car rental made entirely using the card. Most will also 
				extend warranty of any product bought with the card by 1 calendar year.</p>
				<p class="list">3. Rewards! Most good credit cards come with perks like 1% cashback on all purchases or 5% rotating cashback categories, and sometimes a signup bonus of up to $300 cashback.</p>
                <p class="title">Rules for Credit Cards:</p>
				<p class="list">1. Don't get a card with annual fees, unless you think you can recoup the fees with the rewards from the card.</p>
				<p class="list">2. Never buy anything on a credit card that you can't pay for with cash. The interest accumulated by only making minimum payments is not worth it. Wait until you can buy the product in full
				before you buy something with a credit card.</p>
				<p class="title">How do I find cards for me?</p>
				<p>It may be hard to obtain a credit card if you have no credit history. If you are a student, this can be somewhat mitigated by student credit cards. They will typically accept applications from
				students with little or no credit history, as long as proof of enrollment is provided. Otherwise, look into secured credit cards with your bank to start building credit.</p>
                <a class="link" href="http://bit.ly/1CGR3fE"><img src="https://www.discovercard.com/discover/images/account/customerservice/cards/DISCOVER_IT.gif" alt="Discover It Card"/></a>
				The <a class="link" href="http://bit.ly/1CGR3fE">Discover It Card</a> is a student card that comes with 5% cashback rotating categories. Right now, the category is online shopping (you can get 5% cashback on all purchases made online)!
				Also, if you apply through the link above (my referral link), you and I both get $50 cashback after you make your first purchase with the card (the normal amount of cashback is $20). Another benefit of having this
				card is it will give you your TransUnion credit score on every statement (the score is also available online). </p>
				<p>Another good card is the <a class="link" href="https://www.salliemae.com/credit-cards/sallie-mae-card/">Sallie Mae Mastercard</a>, which I also own. It comes with 5% back on gas, groceries, and books (Amazon counts as a bookstore!). You also get
				$25 cashback after your first purchase. However, this card may be a little harder to get (it's not strictly a student card, so you need some good credit history to get approved).
				</p>
